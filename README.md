# ComutationalPhysics8_QM
This code aims to study the various important phenomena that take place in quantum mechanics, via the use of the implicit Crank-Nicholson numerical method. Specifically,
Born’s statistical interpretation of the wave function, whose evolution is predicted by Schrödinger’s equation, will be discussed. In doing so, we will numerically confirm Heisenberg’s
uncertainty principle regarding a quantum particle’s energy and momentum, and we will qualitatively analyse the similarities between the quantum and classical descriptions of a
particle in a harmonic potential, which arise partly due to Ehrenfest’s theorem. Finally, the quantum tunelling effect will be observed, and a model will be put in place to understand
what happens to the wave function when a particle is detected.
